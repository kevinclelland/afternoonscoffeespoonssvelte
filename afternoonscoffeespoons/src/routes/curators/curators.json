		"bio": "Mark was born in Durban in 1967. to an immigrant Hungarian circus performer and his mother who was born in Zimbabwe. His first lesson already began before he was born as his Father disappeared before he was born. He had to deal with abandonment. His mother married a British orphan who grew up in Zimbabwe who was often violent, abusive and also an alcoholic. Mark then also had to learn how to be with abuse. They moved to the UK in the late 70’s and lived in a very poor council estate. Mark went to a rough & tough school and was bullied badly for 3 years. He learnt to run and was forced to learn to fight and stand up for himself. Whilst dealing with a troubled alcoholic step father that made home life unpredictable and violent Mark took refuge in music and started his love of a melody with the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel and Creedence Clearwater Revival. This developed into a much wider range as his curiosity and enjoyment was activated from Otis Redding to David Bowie and checking out nearly all the different genre’s of music. Not wanting to follow the path of his parents caused Mark to search for answers and he read his first spiritual book at 16. He also decided to take up Kick Boxing and martial arts to deal with the growing aggression inside of himself. In 1990 after getting to 1st Dan level he entered an open European kick boxing tournament and won it in his weight division of super featherweight. Being exposed to different cultures enabled Mark to look at societies & cultures from the outside in and saw what he later discovered was conditioning also herd mentality he decided to take a different path. After many wrong turns and also getting a bit lost in the “party” scene he decided to return to SA in 1996. This led him eventually to the self-development and coaching world. There he became an international Master Trainer for Creative Consciousness and a coach at the top of his field. That only happened after further intense life challenges like losing his life partner (Hayley) and mother to his eldest daughter in a fatal car accident. Mark also was scarred and his brain impacted by this accident. This is when he decided to use the tools he had learnt on himself and to continue serving others through consciousness development and coaching. He picked himself up after the accident and as a single Dad created a successful international coaching & coach training business. Now Mark has over 10,000 hours of being in service to others over the last 16 years and also coaches CEO’s, Teams and individuals and a journey to discover their authentic self and truest nature outside of societal conditioning. He is also now a family man with his wife Jessie and daughters Jude (from Hayley) and Jamie (from Jessie) who keep him grounded and provide the opportunity to continue growing & healing internally.",

It was then that he decided that his future lay in the music business. Martin’s break came that same year when he organized a gig for the legendary Sipho Hotstix Mabuse at UCT in 1985. The personal and professional relationship with Sipho Mabuse was established then and remains solid over 35 years later. Together they have worked on numerous projects, including the 46664 Mandela Day Concert in New York in July 2009. For 16 years, Martin was BMG/ Sony Music's Cape Town publicist and marketing person working closely with local and international acts including Vusi Mahlasela, BLK Sonshine, Shayne Ward, Just Jinger, SSQ and John Legend amongst the many artists. He was also partner in leading technical company SMD Technical for 15 years and co founded the crew agency called Crew U. In 2009 Martin founded Music Exchange, a non profit body which organizes an annual music conference designed to empower people in the music industry, especially young artists, with the knowledge necessary to turn their passion into a sustainable livelihood. Music Exchange has grown significantly, and now hosts regular workshops across the year with leading figures from the world of music. It is recognized as South Africa’s leading independent music conference. The conference now in its 10th year is held annually in September and has brought to South Africa many highly respected international speakers to Cape Town. World music leaders with gravitas including: Charles Goldstuck, the President and Chief Executive Officer of TouchTunes Interactive Networks, and formerly the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Bertelsmann Music Group (U.S.), a division of Sony Music Entertainment, one of the world’s leading music companies; Dr Trevor Jones, (whom we manage in South Africa), one of the world’s leading film composers, based in Hollywood and London, who grew up in District 6; from Australia, Stuart Rubin , the head of marketing for BMG Record Company, and David Vodika chairman of Rubber Records Australia; and in 2014 from Germany, Tim Renner, the Minister for Culture for Berlin and from the United States, Mos Def and in 2015 we had Bryan Michael Cox 9 time Grammy winner and Brandon Bakshi head of BMI London. Martin also manages RJ Benjamin, Siphokazi Jonas and Dr Trevor Jones work in South Africa and consults to various artists especially in the W Cape. My ultimate SA Music top 10 is based on a shared experience of where the music has taken me and placed me. Each song continues to take me to a place in time to this day and the songs bring joy to me every time I play them and that's the power of music. Music has been my DNA since those early days in the 80’s at UCT and continues to play a vital role in my daily life.",
