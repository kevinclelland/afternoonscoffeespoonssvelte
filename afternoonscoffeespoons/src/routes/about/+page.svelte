A home for life defining albums. No playlists. No singles.
<br><br>
A desk, an afternoon and an abundance of time. Your favourite music player on hand set to just the right volume. To the left - a full coffeecup. To the right - a stack of albums...your albums. You start with the first...press play...and...YES!
<br><br>
For the rest of the Afternoon the only relativity time has is your stirring of a Coffeespoon while the kettle boils.
<br><br>
The name is inspired by the Crash Test Dummies song "Afternoons & Coffeespoons" which took inspiration from the poem The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T.S Eliot.
